Integration Testing


UI Testing: Few other sample test conditions can be as follows:

Are the menu options generating the correct window?
Are the windows able to invoke the window under test?
For every window, identify the function calls for the window that the application should allow.
Identify all calls from the window to other features that the application should allow
Identify reversible calls: closing a called window should return to the calling window.
Identify irreversible calls: calling windows closes before called window appears.
Test the different ways of executing calls to another window e.g. â€“ menus, buttons, keywords.


- Understand the architecture of your application.
- Identify the modules
- Understand what each module do
- Understand how the data is transferred from one module to another.
- Understand how the data is entered and received into the system ( entry point and exit point of the application)
- Segregate the application to suite your testing needs.
- Identify and create the test conditions
- Take one condition at a time and write down the test cases.
